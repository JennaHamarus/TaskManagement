Task Management Backend

I started this school project with youtube tutorial. First I created a complete application following a tutorial and then modified it to meet the requirements of the assignment.

In this project I've used:

Backend:         * Visual Studio
                 * Swagger
                 * ASP.NET
                 * C#

Frontend:         * Visual Studio Code
                  * React
                  * TypeScript
                  * React Router
                  * Scss

Database:       * SQL Server Management Studio

Version controll:  * GitHub

The styling was created manually using SCSS.
